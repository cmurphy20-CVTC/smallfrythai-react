# smallFryThai

I created this site as a challenge to myself, there are a few restaurants in my area that do not have their own websites. The inspiration for the site came from 
my love of Thai food and it grew from there. I used a name generator to come up with the name Small Fry Thai, also I am a fan of puns. With the name I thought that the
feel of the site should be energetic, light and fun. The main challenge I had was figuring out the layout of each page and what content to include. A popular food truck
in my area is Dhimiters, so I used there site for ideas how to display things like the menu. I'll breakdown the technology used, features and challenges.

Technologies Used

For a responsive modern looking website I used Bootstrap so that the content will resize for various screens. The pages were created utilizing HTML and the content was formatted with CSS. I also used jQuery for some custom animations. This site is hosted on Netlify.

Features

To keep with the energetic and light feel of the site I pirmarily used the colors white and orange. As the user hovers over the menu items css animates each item to show
which item is focused on. The user can also navigate to other pages like the 2023 schedule for the truck and find out more about the people who operate the truck. There is also a form users can fill out to request catering. The info from the form is then sent to an email adddress I control. 

Challenges 

The main challenge was figuring out the look of the site. I had an idea for the feel but wasn't exactly sure of how to display it. So I took ideas from a great site 
for the Dhimiters food truck. A couple examples of ideas are the sample menu on the main page and the changing colors for the schedule. The Dhimiters site has a form
for interested parties to fill out and request catering. After some research, I figured out that Netlify can handle form submimssions and even provide spam filtering.
Netlify also has the ability to host the site. So any commits pushed to the remote repository automatically updates the hosted site.

Note when visitng the site please give a few moments for the images to load, as Netlify can be a little slow.
