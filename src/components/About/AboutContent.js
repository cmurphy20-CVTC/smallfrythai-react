      <p>We are three friends who graduated from culinary school together. One day we had the idea
        to open our own food truck. However, we faced a problem that every graduates faces, we were broke.
        So we saved up our money and eventually were able to open our own truck here in the Chippewa Valley!</p>

      <p>One thing the three of us could agree on is to serve Thai food becuase it's That food! We
        loved these dishes and have a passion for making them. Don't let our name fool you our dish pack
        a lot of flavor! We hope to see you at one of our events this summer!
